# CMD-Data-Management
A full stack website to manage conductivity data generated by CMD electromagnetic conductivity meters (CMD-1, CMD-4 and CMD-EX) from [GF Instruments](http://www.gfinstruments.cz/index.php?menu=gi&smenu=iem&cont=cmd_&ear=ov).

## How to install
1. Install docker and docker-compose
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. visit http://localhost:3000

## Background of the project
Electromagnetic conductivity mapping is a novel tool to assess the land health because potential contamination areas caused by heavy metal or organic carbons are usually associated with abnormally low conductivity of the soil. CMD electromagnetic conductivity meters from GF Instruments can be used to generate conductivity values of the site with real-time GPS device. By utilizing spatial interpolation and contour mapping, these arbnomal areas can be identified quickly and intuitively. However, geophysical processing programs that are commonly used like [Surfer](https://www.goldensoftware.com/products/surfer) are all commercial software. This web app fills the gap between doing the field work and getting the result, thus accelerating the work flow of assessing the target field. 

## Tech stack
1. Django and Django Rest Framework as backend
2. ReactJs as frontend
3. Tailwind CSS as CSS framework
4. Pykrige as spating interpolation library (kriging)
5. Matplotlib as plotting library
6. Docker as containerization tool
